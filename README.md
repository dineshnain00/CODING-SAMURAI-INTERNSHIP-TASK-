Project Title: CODING SAMURAI INTERNSHIP TASK

Overview
This repository contains the projects completed as part of the Coding Samurai Data Science Internship. The internship focuses on providing hands-on experience and developing industry-relevant skills through real-world projects.

Projects
A minimum of two projects must be completed for the successful completion of the internship. The projects can be from the same or different levels.  
Here are the projects included in this repository:

Project 1: Simple Data Analytics - Sales Data Analysis
Description: This project involves analyzing a small dataset, specifically sales data from a retail store. The focus is on basic descriptive statistics and creating visualizations like bar charts and pie charts.  
Skills: Data cleaning, basic statistics, and visualization using tools like Excel or Google Sheets.  

Project 2:Linear Regression on Simple Dataset
Description: The goal of this project is to build a linear regression model using a simple dataset, such as predicting sales based on advertising spending.  
Skills: Understanding of regression analysis, Python, and the Scikit-learn library.  


Project 3: Data Analytics - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset
Description: This project involves performing EDA on the Titanic dataset. It includes examining missing values, data distribution, and relationships between features, with basic visualizations like histograms and correlation heatmaps.  
Skills: Data wrangling, data visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib), and a basic understanding of statistics.  

Project 4: Classification - Logistic Regression on the Titanic Dataset
Description: The project requires building a logistic regression model to predict survival on the Titanic using passenger features such as age, sex, and class.  
Skills: Classification techniques, model evaluation, and feature engineering using Python and Scikit-learn. 


Project 5: Time Series Forecasting for Stock Prices
Description: This project focuses on using historical stock prices to create a time series forecasting model, such as ARIMA or LSTM, to predict future prices.  
Skills: Time series analysis, ARIMA, LSTM models, and evaluation of forecast accuracy.  

Project 6: Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data
Description: This project involves collecting social media data (e.g., tweets) and performing sentiment analysis to determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.  
Skills: Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis using libraries like NLTK or TextBlob, and data cleaning
